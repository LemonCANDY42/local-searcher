# Changelog

## 0.3.12 (2026-05-19)

### Fixed

- Replace the SearXNG quickstart `docker run` example with repository-managed Docker Compose flows for macOS/Linux and Windows PowerShell.
- Mount the bundled SearXNG `settings.yml` directly so JSON search output is enabled reliably for MCP clients.
- Add a Windows `services/manage.ps1` helper and document JSON API verification as the readiness check, not just Web UI availability.
- Keep the bundled SearXNG engine list curated for MCP web search instead of relying on the noisy default engine set.

## 0.3.11 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed

- Expose `agent-searchkit` as the default npm bin so plain `npx -y agent-searchkit@latest` starts the MCP server.
- Accept LF-only MCP stdio headers in addition to CRLF headers for more tolerant GUI client handshakes.
- Simplify MCP setup docs to the package-name `npx` command.

## 0.3.10 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed

- Unify MCP setup guidance around npm/npx commands instead of OS-specific command wrappers.
- Lazy-load the heavy search bundle after MCP initialization so LM Studio can complete the stdio handshake before search code is loaded.

## 0.3.9 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed

- Add LM Studio-specific MCP setup guidance that uses the same npm/npx command shape as other MCP clients.
- Report the MCP server version from `package.json` instead of a hard-coded value.

## 0.3.8 (2026-05-18)

### Fixed

- Fix npx-based MCP install examples for packages with multiple bin entries by using `--package agent-searchkit@latest agent-searchkit-mcp`.
- Normalize npm package metadata so future publishes do not rely on npm auto-corrections.

## 0.3.7 (2026-05-18)

### Changed

- Enhance the OpenClaw `web_search` provider adapter with citation-aware structured output, including `citation`, `sources`, `rank`, `publishedDate`, rerank metadata, and optional `mode` / `rerankVersion` controls.
- Clarify Quickstart setup for OpenClaw, MCP, and other agent/CLI integrations.
- Replace the misleading reranking-pipeline wording with mutually exclusive rerank strategy versions, and document how benchmark runs compare those versions.
- Replace old low-level CLI names with project-named commands (`agent-searchkit-search`, `agent-searchkit-research`) and clarify that CLI examples are direct SearXNG smoke tests rather than the OpenClaw provider path.
- Add a real `agent-searchkit-mcp` npm bin, MCP smoke test, CI workflow, and release-triggered npm publish workflow.

## 0.3.6 (2026-05-17)

### Fixed

- Implement the OpenClaw 2026.5.12 web-search provider runtime contract with provider-owned `createTool(...)` so `tools.web.search.provider = "agent-searchkit"` works at call time.

## 0.3.5 (2026-05-17)

### Fixed

- Move the OpenClaw web-search provider declaration to `contracts.webSearchProviders` so OpenClaw 2026.5.12+ can select `agent-searchkit` as `tools.web.search.provider`.

## 0.3.4 (2026-05-17)

### Changed

- Document OpenClaw 2026.5.12+ install behavior for `node:child_process` safety warnings and recommend `--dangerously-force-unsafe-install` only for trusted installs.
- Add `esbuild` as an explicit dev dependency so fresh checkouts can run `npm run build`.

### Fixed

- Fix the test manifest import path and align renamed `agent-searchkit` matching fixtures.

## 0.4.0 (2026-05-17)

### Renamed

- **Renamed** from `local-searcher` to `agent-searchkit`

### Features

- **OpenClaw web-search provider** — plugin registers as an OpenClaw web-search provider; set `tools.web.search.provider: "agent-searchkit"` to make `web_search` use SearXNG + reranking automatically
- **Citation mode** — pass `citations=true` to `web_searchkit_search` to get numbered references `[1], [2], ...` with formatted citation text for each result
- **Search query optimization guide** — `docs/query-optimization.md` with keyword extraction, operator reference, and reformulation strategies for agents
- **Agent skills** — ready-to-use integration guides for OpenClaw, MCP, LangChain, CrewAI, and standalone CLI (`skills/`)

## 0.3.0 (2026-05-15)
